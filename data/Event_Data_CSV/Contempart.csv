<p>Jade Chan's design for the Rockaway barriers is titled In Flight. When she visited Rockaway Beach, she was inspired by the warmth, the sun and the colors that jumped out at her from the sky, water and sand. The sound of the surf and the breeze upon her skin was exhilarating. She observed the birds in flight and was inspired by this free and liberating vision. Chan sees In Flight as a representation of the freedom and strength of the human spirit. </p><p>Learn more about the <a href=""/art-and-antiquities/rockaway-beautification"">Rockaway Barrier Beautification Project</a>.</p>","Q","1","40.5882","-73.8119","1"

<p>As an artist, Patty Harris has created animations of floods and is fascinated by the way water moves. Experienced in looking closely at the sea, she pulled a few simple forms that suggest the movement and pattern of a wave. For the Shore Parkway barrier, Patty painted shapes that express the undulating movement of a wave. She added curved shapes that hold water of a slightly different color—just as actual water displays a range of hues. To this rhythmical simple pattern, Harris included the silhouetted forms of surfers at the crests of the waves.</p>

<p>As a surf regular of Rockaway Beach, John Garcia pays tribute to Rockaway BeachÂ??s surf culture in his barrier mural. He has painted images of Rockaway surfers riding waves, along with the birds that often keep them company on the water and on the shore. These images of birds and surfers sit on top of an aquatic abstract backdrop that captures the mystery and beauty of the ocean. The barriers also include the text Â??Welcome to the RockawaysÂ?Â as an invitation for others to experience the waves and serenity of Rockaway Beach.</p>

"5","Toro","Allen Glatter","2015-04-17","2016-03-20","character(0)","<p>“At first  sight, the sculpture of Allen Glatter might appear to be a literal take on Paul  Klee’s remark that a drawing is simply a line going on a walk. Each work,  including Toro, takes the form of a continuous curve zigzagging through space,  rising from the ground to above eye level and traversing the better part of a  gallery room, or in the case of the outdoor work, a sidewalk. Constructed from  seamlessly joined steel tubing, uniform in diameter, the freestanding  sculptures simultaneously gather and perforate the spaces around them. Walking  around the work produces a pleasant feeling that seems to derive from a rhythm  of anticipation and surprise; despite the few formal elements involved, the  overall experience varies radically from one vantage point to another. Each  sculpture has a definite axis, and when viewed in that direction, the piece  tends to open up into a number of loop windows. Though there are many changes  of direction in its path, the curve is less of a meandering walk than a sequence  of turns, an itinerary.” </p>

The High Line is the ideal  stage for this series of sculptures and installations, all of which explore the  act of seeing and understanding the spectacle of nature. The exhibition  challenges historical notions of the sublime, quasi-religious experiences of  “untouched” nature, and the debate on the manicured versus the ostensibly  natural garden, opening up the possibility for experiencing nature in its  necessarily human-impacted state. *Olafur Eliasson’s The Collectivity Project  will be on view from mid-May to mid-September 2015. </p>

"8","Fat Boy","Leonard Ursachi","2015-05-01","2016-04-15","character(0)","<p>The latest in Ursachi’s decades-long “bunker” series, Fat  Boy is an oversized head embedded with three recessed bunker windows fitted  with mirrors instead of glass. Measuring 9.5 feet tall and 8.5 feet wide, the  artwork was carved from styrofoam and covered in a weatherproof, cementitious  material. Fat Boy is Ursachi’s first bunker sculpture in the form of a head.  His previous bunkers, one of which was on view in at the entrance of Prospect  Park off Grand Army Plaza in 2007, have been cylindrical and made with a  variety of materials such as turkey feathers, willow branches, and ceramic  tiles. “My bunkers reference not only war but also nests, shelter and refuge. They  are as much about longing for home as they are about conflict, ” states  Ursachi. </p>
<p>  Fat Boy is based on a classical Western putto, or male child  often depicted in Renaissance and Baroque artworks. “Since antiquity,” says the  artist, “putti have been malleable signifiers, representing, among other  things, Eros, panic, abandon, and joy.” Fat Boy’s title derives not only from  his plump, cherubic face, but also from the WWII atomic bombs, Little Boy and  Fat Man, giving the sculpture twin references to Eros and war. </p>
<p>  Fat Boy was first exhibited at the John & Mable Ringling  Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, which is a partial sponsor of this exhibit.

"9","Blocks","Rashid Johnson","2015-05-01","2016-03-31","character(0)","<p>Inspired by a childhood steeped in African American cultural  influences, Rashid Johnson creates layered artworks that engage a conversation  between personal biography and the implied gravitas of larger cultural and  historical narratives. Johnson works predominantly in mixed media sculptures  and paintings, combining bare materials such as mirror, wood, and shea butter  with loaded iconic objects including record covers, CB radios, historical  books, and common domestic objects. Throughout his career, Johnson has explored  the ways in which we form our sense of belonging to races and communities,  investigating the relationship between familiar objects and identity.</p>
<p>For his High Line Commission, Johnson built one of his minimalist  three-dimensional steel black grids, which houses a variety of objects  including busts painted to resemble shea butter (a material commonly used by  the artist), and acts as a living greenhouse as plants on the High Line begin  to intertwine with the sculpture over the year of its installation. Playing  with forms taken from the Minimalist tradition – Sol LeWitt’s white open cubes  come to mind – Johnson turns them into a reflection on blackness by breaking  the rational structure open and embedding loaded objects within it.</p>
<p>Installed in an oblong island of plants growing between pathways on the  High Line just south of The Standard, High Line, the sculpture will change over  the course of its installation, the empty rectilinear vessel becoming a  horticultural container as the seasons pass. The work reflects the artist’s  ongoing interest in a line from a book by Lawrence Weiner called “Something to  Put Something On,” in which the concept “table” is explained as “something to put  something on.” This semiotic explication resonates with Johnson, who pushes its  implications toward thinking about the ways in which lives, cultures, and  historical arcs are a mere practice of putting some things on top other things  that are imagined to be taken as given, such as the exemplary case of the  table.</p>

Four additional works dating from 2011 and 2012  will also be included in the exhibition. The sculptures range in height from  eight feet to 14 feet.</p>
<p>“I first became interested in haiku poems because of the  simplicity of their structure,” stated the artist. “Three lines stacked  together containing 17 syllables. Five in the first line, seven in the middle,  and five in the third line. I thought of substituting shapes for the syllables  and instead of writing a poem with three sentences and 17 syllables, I made a  sculpture with three vertical sections and 17 shapes, five in the bottom  section, seven in the middle, and five in the top section. The three sections  are separated by horizontal, linear flat rectangles, my version of lined paper.</p>
<p>“I thought that making a series of sculptures that shared a  common structural theme would unite them along their shared route on Broadway.  I also wanted to see how much variety I could create within a given set of  rules. Five sculptures are based on the haiku idea and the other four  sculptures have similar stacked elements, and I think they structurally relate  to the others.”</p>
<p>A cell phone tour, in English and Spanish, which will  include the artist’s commentary, is funded by Con Edison.</p>

"11","Fata Morgana","Teresita Fernandez","2015-06-01","2016-03-31","character(0)","<p>Fata Morgana by New York-based  artist Teresita FernÁndez, consists of 500 running feet of golden,  mirror-polished discs that create canopies above the pathways around the Park’s  central Oval Lawn.</p>
<p>In nature, a Fata Morgana is a  horizontal mirage that forms across the horizon line. Alluding to this  phenomenon, Fernandez’s project introduces a shimmering horizontal element to  the Park that engages visitors in a dynamic experience. The installation is a  mirror-polished, golden metal sculpture that hovers above the Park’s winding  walkways to define a luminous experiential passage for Park visitors. The metal  forms, perforated with intricate patterns reminiscent of foliage, creates  abstract flickering effects as sunlight filters through the canopy, casting a  golden glow across the expanse of the work, paths, and passersby. The  project is Mad. Sq. Art’s first to fully utilize the upper register of a  visitor’s space.</p>
<p>“<em>Fata Morgana</em> is a site-specific work  designed for, and inspired by, Madison Square Park,” said Ms.  FernÁndez. “My concept was to invert the traditional notion of outdoor  sculpture by addressing all of the active walkways of the Park rather than  setting down a sculptural element in the Park’s center. By hovering over the  Park in a horizontal band, <em>Fata Morgana</em> becomes a ghost-like,  sculptural, luminous mirage that both distorts the landscape and radiates  golden light.”</p>

The  garden was conceived and constructed circa 1916 by the prominent architectural  firm of Delano & Aldrich and recently restored in 2013. </p>
<p>Animals  were a theme to which Lachaise returned throughout his artistic career. He  sculpted peacocks, seagulls; swans, dolphins. The animals he chose to represent  were generally peaceful animals. The commissions for his animal works came  through his employer, the artist, Paul Manship (1885-1956) or architects with  whom he worked, including Welles Bosworth (1868-1966) and Philip Goodwin  (1885-1958). </p>
<p>In the case  of the short-tailed peacock, John Deering commissioned Lachaise in 1920 to make  two sculptural peacocks in stone to sit atop eight decorative spiral columns in  the Marine Garden of the home he was building outside of Miami, called Vizcaya.  Philip Goodwin commissioned the long-tailed peacock for a fountain on the wall  of his mansion on Long Island. In a poetic twist, Goodwin worked for Delano  & Aldrich between 1914-1916.</p>

"13","A Bench for the Night","Fanny Allie","2015-05-18","2016-05-01","PS1 Greenstreet (Jackson Avenue and 46th Avenue), Queens","<p>Artist Fanny AlliÉ raises awareness about homelessness in her public art  installation <em>A Bench for the Night. </em>Her  wooden bench is shaped in the silhouette of a sleeping person, a reminder that  a public bench is a potential bed for some New Yorkers.  She is interested in personifying the bench  while subtly referring to the dehumanization of people living on the streets.</p>
<p><em>A Bench for the Night</em> is a continuation of AlliÉ’s focus on this  important social issue. In 2014 she took part in the Engaging Artists Residency  organized by the <a href=""http://avcenter.org/engaging-artists/"">Artist Volunteer Center</a> and <a href=""http://moreart.org/"">More Art</a>, which primarily focused on homelessness. <em>Engaging Artists</em><em> </em>encourages local artists to deepen  their understanding of socially engaged art through volunteer opportunities and  interactive workshops with professionals in the fields of fine art and  activism. During this six–week program, participants were required to volunteer  at least a half a day per week at a local charitable organization.</p>
<p>  In 2013, AlliÉ also exhibited the public artwork <em>Serendipity </em>in Tompkins Square Park. The sculpture was a life–size,  steel silhouette of a formerly homeless man who spent much of his time in the  park. Furthermore, <em>A Bench for the Night</em> is the continuation of her earlier neon sculpture <em>The Glowing Homeless</em> created in 2011 for <em>Bring to Light: Nuit Blanche New York </em>in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. <em>The Glowing Homeless</em> was a neon outline  of a human form that rested on a park bench. By rendering the homeless person  in neon light asleep amongst the park’s crowds she created an alluring object  using an attractive material that reversed the normal reaction of avoidance and  instead drew people towards the form on the bench. AlliÉ’s new A <em>Bench For the Night</em> will invite the  audience to sit on the bench, an interaction between the public and the artwork  that was not possible with <em>The Glowing  Homeless</em>.</p>
<p>  While A <em>Bench For a Night </em>primarily  alludes to homelessness, the piece also reflects one’s desire to seek an  isolated place to rest and remove oneself from the continuous movement of the  city. When preparing for this exhibit, AlliÉ noticed a lack of seating in the  immediate vicinity. By placing the bench–sculpture in this small plaza, she has  created a new social space that simultaneously raises awareness on homelessness  among the general public, as well as artists and art–lovers visiting MoMA PS1 located  across the street. </p>","Q","1","40.745575","-73.946588","1"

Appearing Rooms is a systematically changing installation with walls of water that create rooms which appear and disappear. Visitors may move from space to space as the jets of water rise and fall. Mirror Labyrinth NY is made with equidistantly spaced vertical planks of mirror-polished stainless steel. Arranged in three radial arcs, the alternating rhythm and uneven heights of the steel elements echo the Manhattan skyline. Connecting these two works and continuing along the length of the park, the artist has installed sixteen bright red Modified Social Benches. These witty sculptures reinvent the form of the park bench, turning it into a lyrical and evocative work of art.

The work is inspired by  the study of celestial bodies: the influence of the sun, moon, planets and  zodiac constellations on human affairs and the natural world. Rodriguez invites  the public to consider the mysteries of astrology and engage in contemplation  and inner reflection while walking through the sculpture. The sculpture is  located on the lawn just inside Tompkins Square Park at St. Mark’s Place and  Avenue A.</p>
<p>In  addition to the installation at Tompkins Square, four sculptures will accompany  his permanent sculpture <em>Growth</em> at the  East Harlem Art Park at 120th Street and Sylvan Place. ""I have tried to  capture the interaction between trees, birds, insects, flowers, and man.

Though feathers appear fragile and weightless, sculpture was  fabricated with stained and sealed birch plywood and stands at 12 feet  tall.Ã?Â  He notes that a feather is the  symbolic remains of a journey or flight. Bird migration gracefully parallels  the journey taken by people around the world. The diversity of New York City  makes it an interesting and fertile arena for this homage to cultural diversity  and migration. He also hopes that the sculpture will draw people from other  neighborhoods to the park, adding an additional layer of movement. </p>
<p>The Riverside Park Bird Sanctuary runs from 116th Street to  124th Street. Since 1997, the approximately 10 acres of the Sanctuary have been  undergoing reforestation, and over 3,000 plants have been added. In the last  thirty years 177 species of birds have been seen in or around the Sanctuary,  with a yearly average of about 120 species. Visitors can expect to see the blue  grosbeak, summer tanager, hooded warbler, mourning warbler and nine species of  sparrows, among others.

The bell is silent now, as the tower  was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction.  Simultaneously, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and New York City is  experiencing a resurgence of public culture. caesura seeks to temporarily fill  an architectural gap – and create a social space – by echoing and inverting the  form and function of the absent tower. Like the bell, caesura aims to call up  the neighborhood, to preserve and revitalize Harlem’s histories, and to connect  newer and older community members to each other, by reactivating this site for  congregation, viewing, and listening. The installation will reframe history  with a temporary structure and sound. A “caesura” is a break or pause, a place  to catch your breath, most specifically in ancient spoken-word art. </p>
<p>The architectural component of this piece begins at the Acropolis  ground as an open-air, steel frame that supports a “horizontal tower”, which  the viewer can pass through and meander under. In the center of the piece, a  flattened “bell” made of reflective steel. </p>
<p>The sonic component of the piece consists of Feldman’s interactive  composition, made up of bell sounds and voices. Historical and contemporary  recordings and live-streaming voices from speeches, rallies, chants, and  assemblies in Harlem are alternated with a through-composed layer of echoing  bells. Analogous to a megaphone, the formal profile of the tower has been  tipped sideways, allowing sound to be projected outward. Taut, translucent film  runs through this shape and is mounted with electromagnetic transducers that  turn the material into a speaker, allowing sound to pour down from the spaces  in between the arches above visitors. A microphone mounted at the entrance to  the installation allows visitors to broadcast their own voices through the  piece. Those not present can participate through an interactive online  component, allowing them to trigger the bell and contribute their own live  audio to the arches. New and old histories are recorded, spliced, and digitally  scripted together, activating the acropolis throughout the day.</p>

<p>In response  to this year’s theme of Patterns in Nature, the artists created a sinuous steel  twisted sculpture. The fluke of a tail runs down like a rolling wave and  culminates to form the head of a water drop. The downward flow of the fish-wave  form echoes the landscape of the hill of the Van Cortlandt House Museum, which  drops quickly down a Southward hill, and the south-running Tibbett’s Brook  through Van Cortlandt Park down to the City.</p>
<p>The shiny stainless-steel  sculpture reflects the park in a similar way that water’s surface reflects the  surrounding trees. Additionally the sculpture is a nod to the water sources  that surrounds the piece–the Nature Center to the North which provides an  exploratory, scientific perspective of the parks ecosystems. To the West, the Pool is run with engineered water systems. By contrast, Van Cortland Lake is located to the east and wetlands to the south. </p>
<p>This collaborative installation was created by artists Lee Apt, Caroline Bergonzi, Kate Jansyn, Sukyung Kim, Donat King, Paola Morales, and Ken Shih.  The group also has works concurrently on view in Riverside South Park in Manhattan. </p>

Her work often concentrates on creating beautiful, unexpected moments  within urban and abandoned spaces. As a resident of the East Village, she  continues this exploration inher  installation <em>Whattoseesottahw</em>, where  sheembraces the often ambiguous  nature of children’s drawings. In her workshops, children and families visiting  Tompkins Square were encouraged to create images of familiar wildlife that they  encountered in the park. These drawings and paintings may appear indecipherable  at a first glance, similar to a Rorschach test; however, when children are  asked to elaborate they create joyful stories about the natural elements they  observed. </p>
<p>Several  of these drawings were collected and combined to create images that were  transferred onto wood panels. The images were then either cut out of the panel,  revealing glances of the park, or partially removed with half of the drawing  still visible. Some of the cutouts were painted with chalk paint so kids can  complete the drawing. The panels, located in the Slocum Memorial Fountain  Plaza, are low on the fence in order to maintain a relationship with children’s  eye level. Linardaki will periodically conduct workshops throughout the  exhibition in the sitting area behind the park house.  </p>

Born  in Birmingham, Alabama, raised in South Central Los Angeles in the 1970s, and  currently based in Chicago, Marshall is acutely sensitive to his own social  responsibility as an artist. The artist plunges his work into an exploration of  race-consciousness, painting “unequivocally, emphatically black figures,”  through whose depiction he articulates his intention to “reclaim the image of  blackness as an emblem of power.” Marshall has been commissioned to complete  numerous permanent public works at locations including the Legler Branch  Library in Chicago, The Print Center in Philadelphia, and the San Francisco  Museum of Modern Art’s Haas Atrium.</p>
<p>For the High Line, Marshall presents  a large-scale, hand-painted mural adapted specifically for the High Line.  Titled <em>Above the Line</em>, the mural is an extension of the artist’s <em>Dailies</em> series, specifically the cartoon strip “Rhythm Mastr,” an epic narrative of the  struggle between tradition and modernity within the Afro-diasporic worldview.  The works address the lack of black superheroes found in American comics, and  raise historical and philosophical questions in black vernacular English. This  particular comic painting, <em>Above the Line</em>, imagines the redevelopment of  rooftop water tanks as luxury homes and condominiums.</p>

"25","Against the Run","Alicja Kwade","2015-09-10","2016-02-22","Doris C. Freedman Plaza","<p>Nature provided us with a general  way to measure time: dividing it into days, lunar months, and seasons. Since  ancient times, however, we have invented ways of measuring time in smaller  units with ever–increasing precision — from the sundial to the hourglass to the  atomic clock. As clock making technology advanced during the Renaissance,  handsome public clocks became a source of civic pride, as well as a useful  amenity. In today’s digital age, they more often evoke a sense of nostalgia for  another era.</p>
<p> In <em>Against the Run</em>, Alicja Kwade (b. 1979, Katowice, Poland) has created  a clock that tells the correct time, but does so in a way that confounds expectations.  Adapting a nineteenth–century design that we might typically see in New York  City, the artist has reversed the conventional mechanism. The face of the clock  rotates backwards while the second hand appears to stand still, pointing  vertically at all times. Our understanding of how a clock should run is second  nature, making this variation almost impossible to read, even as it continues  to tell the right time. Kwade’s whimsical clock captures her interest in the  systems we invent to make sense of our lives and the world. In doing so, it  prompts us to see “reality” from a new perspective. </p>

"26","THE MOMENT","Various Artists","2015-09-27","2016-02-29","character(0)","<p>To draw a Contemporary Art forum is to separate from both modern and historical perspectives, to immerse oneself in current time and space. A meeting point in the processing time from past and to the future. We might call it the “moment;” it is short and creative. It entails catching an idea when it appears like a flash of light. It can — and must — disappear in the next femtosecond. A “moment” can mean a minute portion of time, or the product of quantity (as a force) and the distance to a particular point. THE MOMENT in contemporary art can be ideally a philosophical term and scientific necessity.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Taiwanese American Arts Council takes THE MOMENT as a theme, and develops it to a series of multi–disciplinary programs taking place in various venues. The traditional format of painting shares space with the latest interactive technology. These are threads expressing multiple directions, meeting in this MOMENT. The MOMENT investigates the play of the virtual and the real, inward and outward, our intimate reflection on a surface, dark and light, or a view of self in the outside environment. The Moment visualizes a picture, an object, a location, a person, or a fanciful collective memory of how we evolved as creatures. We are about to investigates the artist’s relation to society and himself.</p>
<p>Artists on view in Flushing Meadows Corona Park as part of THE MOMENT include Ya-Hon Chang, Tang-Wei Hsu, Kuang-Yu Lee, Wen-Fu Yu. </p>

The sculpture continues the artist’s contemplation  of time, materiality and place, and is part of <em>Curvae</em>, her series of curved forms. By using Cor–Ten steel, a  corrosion–resistant material that naturally and quickly develops a  weathered–looking patina, Pepper is able to speed up the oxidation process, and  in so doing suggest the concept of elapsed time through the sculpture’s skin of  rust.</p>
<p>Like many of her monumental works, <em>My  Circle</em> engages the viewer through the interplay of convex and concave  forms. The use of opposing forces – vertical and horizontal, interior and  exterior – creates a lyrical meditation of space that is at once dominant and  intimate. The artist has stated that “Seeing, touching, and the physical  sensory engagement is the way into my sculpture; my intention is that the  meaning of my work rests in experiencing it, similar to the performing arts  where listening and seeing the moments of a performance where meaning is  revealed through experience.” She notes that <em>My Circle</em>, standing at fourteen feet tall in Cor–Ten steel, for her  recalls an image from years ago relating to the symbolic character in Zen  Buddhism where it is known as the Enso, a drawing in ink of an open or closed  circle. The closed circle represents the totality of experience and life. The  open circle represents the imperfection found in all things, and is known as  the circle of enlightenment, its symbolism referring to the beginning and end  of all things, the circle of life, and the connectedness of existence. What  Pepper is drawn to within this narrative is the notion of the “connectedness of  existence” and how we can connect people and populations through art.</p>

Klemperer investigates animal populations that were threatened in the 20th century, but are now rebounding and showing up in “our backyard.” Wild animals are finding their way into suburban and urban environments as human populations sprawl into their natural habitats. While many species have been devastated, some are adapting and thriving on the largesse of urban life. Hawks dive from high rise cornices to feast on the rich urban population of pigeons and rats; bears walk through New Jersey neighborhoods; and just several blocks from Court Square Park, a coyote found its way to a rooftop in Long Island City.  </p>
<p> Klemperer’s animal silhouettes are steel forms, punctuated with cutouts in the shape of countries from around the world. Each animal is a melting pot, bearing countries on its body that are also represented in Queens’ population—the most diverse community in the world. </p>

The figures, formed with steel and wrapped in nylon, hold hands and dance whimsically within a rectangular steel structure.  At night the figures light up and cast a glow around the neighboring trees. <em>The Dance</em> is inspired by Henri Matisse’s painting by the same name. Similar interlocked figures can be found throughout art history, including Mayan art, African tribal sculptures, and ancient Mesopotamia, among others, to symbolize family, community, and spiritual or universal connectivity. Lampman uses this symbol for the coming together of the Staten Island community.</p>
<p>Lampman lives and works in Staten Island and has embraced the diverse community made up of residents from around the world. In the exhibition, the five figures are entwined in a dance—they could be Flamenco dancers from Mexico, Kandyan dancers from Sri Lanka, or  a dance from West Africa such as the Yankadi, or the Makru. </p>
<p>Many Staten Island neighborhoods were flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and sadly lives and homes were lost in the storm.  However, Staten Island came together during this crisis—strangers dropped everything and join people from around the island and all over the world to rebuild the community.  The neighborhoods’ joint effort is an integral part of the inspiration for Lampman’s public artwork.  Additionally, Lampman hopes that the installation will inspire additional community development, as the informal pavilion can be used for public dance and music performances by community members. </p>","R","1","40.499764","-74.251476","1"

"32","El Primero Desfile de San Patricio en la Habana, Cuba","Duke Riley","2015-09-27","2016-03-13","character(0)","<p>Socrates’ latest “Broadway Billboard” is by artist Duke  Riley and is titled El Primero Desfile de San Patricio en la Habana, Cuba, or,  The First St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>  St. Patrick’s Day marks the celebration of the life of the  patron saint of Ireland and is observed by people of Irish descent around the  world. But, as Riley states, “the tradition of the St. Patrick’s Day Parade is  entirely American.” The first parade in honor of St. Patrick’s Day was  organized by Irishmen serving in the British army stationed in Boston,  Massachusetts in 1737. It began as nothing more than drunken revelry, singing,  and a shared sense of homesickness. 200 years later the tradition was adopted  in Ireland and today there are St. Patrick’s Day parades in 15 nations across  six continents.</p>
<p>  During a 2007 visit to Havana, Riley discovered that his  Irish roots had Cuban connections. In fact, one of of the city’s main streets  is called Calle O’Reilly, named for Alejandro O’Reilly, an Irishman and early  abolitionist who served as a general in the Spanish army in 18th–century Cuba  and later served as governor of Spanish–occupied Louisiana. Like O’Reilly, many  Irish settled in Cuba in the 18th and 19th centuries, leaving a legacy of  prominent historical figures of Irish–Cuban descent and there are still a great  number of current day Cuban residents with Irish heritage.</p>
<p>  With this history in mind, Duke Riley returned to Cuba in  2009 to stage the first St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Havana, a performance for  ‘Chelsea Visits Havana’ at Museum Nacional de Bellas Artes as part of the  Havana Biennial. The Broadway Billboard on view at Socrates Sculpture Park  consists of a section of a larger drawing the artist did as a record of his  2009 performance, along with representations of iconic American cartoon  characters marching through the streets of Havana.</p>
<p>  Like the first parades in America, Riley’s St. Patrick’s Day  performance reminded participants of the positive potentials of social  inclusion and cultural exchange from the earliest parades and commemorations.  Riley’s 2009 parade displayed a romanticized vision of a distant land –  Ireland, Cuba, and America – separated by the sea. With today’s warming of  relations between historically cool American and Cuban governments, El Primero  Desfile de San Patricio en la Habana, Cuba presciently experiments with the  merging of the two cultures.</p>

OY/YO is sourced from urban and Brooklyn slang, the statement “I am” in Spanish, and the popular Yiddish expression, as a riff on Ruscha’s iconic word paintings. </p>
<p>OY/YO has been a significant and reoccurring motif in Kass’ work since its first appearance in 2011, taking form in paintings, prints, and tabletop sculptures. Set alongside the iconic bridges of Brooklyn’s waterfront and visible to viewers from Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge Park’s Main Street lawn is an apt location for a monumental installation of OY/YO. Similar to the City of New York’s “Leaving Brooklyn: Oy Vey!” sign at the Williamsburg Bridge and the “Leaving Brooklyn: Fuhgeddaboudit” sign on the BQE, OY/YO references Brooklyn’s ethnic communities with whimsy and warmth. </p>
<p>Commissioned by Two Trees and presented in partnership with Brooklyn Bridge Park, the work will be on view through August 2016 and is presented on the occasion of the artist’s exhibition No Kidding opening at Paul Kasmin Gallery in Chelsea December 9, 2015.
