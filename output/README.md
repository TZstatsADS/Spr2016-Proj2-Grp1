## An Overview of Our Product
### Whats and Whys
   Planning a trip can sometimes be as exhausting as developing a R Shiny App. And this is specially true when you are visiting New York, a city that has so much to offer that Even New Yorkers can sometimes have a hard time deciding where to go for a weekend. Therefore, we developed a Shiny App that brings your destinations only a few clicks way from you.
